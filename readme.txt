## Description
The todo list feature enables you to effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks, and conveniently display them on WordPress pages and posts using a simple shortcode.


## Set up the database and tables.
The database tables are automatically created immediately upon activation.


## How to use
Simply utilize the [todolist] shortcode to seamlessly incorporate the task table into your desired pages, posts, or anywhere else you wish to display it.


## Navigation
After the installation, a new menu will appear in the WordPress panel called 'Todo'. By clicking on the 'Todo' menu, the current tasks will be displayed in a table format. If you do not have any tasks, the table will appear empty.

-Create a new task:
On the main page of Todo, simply click on 'Add New Task', and a form will appear for you to fill out. By completing the form, a new task will be added to the list. Alternatively, you can also add a new task by clicking on the 'New Task' submenu.

-Modify the task:
Each task is accompanied by an action button adorned with a pencil icon, serving as the means to modify the task. By clicking on this button, you gain the ability to make changes to the task. You will be presented with three options: update, cancel, and delete. Once the modification is complete, the updated task list will be displayed for your viewing.
